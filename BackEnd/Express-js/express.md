## What is Express.js, and why is it used in web development?

-   Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies and streamlines the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features, middleware, and routing capabilities.


## How do you handle form submissions in Express.js?

-   We use the **express.urlencoded()** middleware to parse incoming form data. This middleware is necessary for handling form submissions.

-  Express.js provides middleware like body-parser to parse form data submitted by clients.

-   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
-   app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));



-   Advantages of Express.js:

-   **Minimalist and Unopinionated**: Express is minimalist, providing essential features for building web applications but allowing developers the freedom to structure their code and use other libraries as needed. It doesn't impose a rigid architecture.

-   **Extensive Middleware**: Express has a vast ecosystem of middleware that can be easily integrated into your application. This includes middleware for routing, authentication, logging, and more. You can also create custom middleware to suit your needs.

-   **Robust Routing**: Express offers flexible and powerful routing capabilities, making it easy to define RESTful APIs and manage routes for different HTTP methods.

-   **High Performance**: Node.js, the underlying runtime for Express, is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which can result in excellent performance, especially for I/O-bound operations.
