# CSS Selectors and Combinators

## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements to apply styles. Below are different types of selectors:

### 1. Universal Selector (`*`):
Selects all elements.
```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```

### 2. Type Selector (Tag Name):
Selects all elements of a specific type.
```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```

### 3. Class Selector (`.classname`):
Selects elements by their class attribute.
```css
.box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
}
```

### 4. ID Selector (`#idname`):
Selects a specific element with a given ID.
```css
#header {
    background-color: gray;
}
```

### 5. Attribute Selector:
Selects elements based on their attributes.
```css
input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```

### 6. Pseudo-Classes:
Targets elements in a specific state.
```css
a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

### 7. Pseudo-Elements:
Targets parts of elements, such as the first line or first letter.
```css
p::first-line {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

## CSS Combinators

CSS combinators are used to combine multiple selectors and target more specific elements.

### 1. Descendant Selector (Space):
Selects elements inside another element.
```css
div p {
    color: green;
}
```

### 2. Child Selector (`>`):
Selects direct child elements.
```css
div > p {
    color: red;
}
```

### 3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`):
Selects an element immediately following another element.
```css
h1 + p {
    color: blue;
}
```

### 4. General Sibling Selector (`~`):
Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
```css
h1 ~ p {
    color: orange;
}
```

## How CSS is Applied

1. **Cascade**: CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, meaning styles are applied in order, and the more specific rules override less specific ones.

2. **Inheritance**: Some properties (like `color` and `font-size`) are inherited from parent elements to child elements unless explicitly overridden.

3. **Specificity**: More specific rules have higher priority. For example, an ID selector is more specific than a class selector.

4. **Order of Appearance**: When two rules have the same specificity, the one declared later in the stylesheet will take precedence.

## Example

Here’s an example of CSS selectors and combinators applied to an HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial;
    }
    div {
      color: green;
    }
    .container > p {
      color: red;
    }
    #unique {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <div>
    <p>This is inside a div, and will be green.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <p>This paragraph will be red due to the child selector.</p>
  </div>

  <p id="unique">This paragraph will be blue due to its unique ID.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- The first `<p>` inside a `div` gets styled green.
- The second `<p>` inside the `.container` class will be red due to the `>` child combinator.
- The paragraph with the `id="unique"` will be blue due to the ID selector's higher specificity.
```

This format is markdown-friendly, making it ideal for GitHub `README.md` files.
